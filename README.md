# Image Hover Effect

A code that helps display images in a container based on the active card.

Grid template areas used in designing the layout. 

`OnMouseOver` is used to track card hover state in order to switch the active card, subsequently switching the image in the container.

Ideal for limited cards, unless you create an advance version to loop the through the cards and place the images based on nth position.
